        <p>My name is Joud Baddawi. I am a 16-year-old girl living in Amman, Jordan.<br>
            In the future, I hope to become a software developer. I want to attend university 
            and own a smart car - preferably red!

        <p>I joined Code Chica to learn the basics of building and designing websites. 
            I want to create my own portfolio and expand from there to many, many more websites. <br>
            I love to listen to music while studying, and I enjoy watching my favorite movies
             on my laptop. I use technology to have fun or connect with friends.

        <p>I live with my family. My mom and dad, my two brothers, and my sister.<br>
            I am a junior at Al Jazeera School, and my favorite classes are English
             and Chemistry. Outside of school, I enjoy coding and reading. I am more
              of an indoor person, but I play basketball and skate to stay active!

        <p> Reading is one of my favorite hobbies. I enjoy 
            all kinds of books, but the genres I love the most 
            are historical fiction and astronomy books! I love 
            reading poetry as well. My favorite authors are Ayman Ottom,
             Ahmad Kayre Al Omari, and Guillaume Musso. My favorite poets 
             are Al mutanabi and Kaleel Jubran.</p>

        <h3> <a id="Creative"> Creative Writing </a> </h3>
        <img class="imageintextleft" src="CP/writing.jpeg">
        <p> Creative writing is a result of reading all the time! 
            Although I don't count creative writing as a fun way to 
            spend time, I love participating in school and nationwide
             competitions. In 2020 I participated in my latest national
              competition and won 100 JOD! (~140 USD). I love to write 
              Arabic literature rather than English literature because the 
              more comprehensive Arabic vocabulary allows for more artistic
               and creative writing. However, the English grammar rules are more forgiving.</p>

        <p> Coding is a passion of mine. So far, I've mastered C++, Python, and HTML. 
            The most painless language to learn for me was HTML. The most challenging 
            is JavaScript. I'm still learning JS, and CodeChica helped me in that aspect.
            Every coding course I participated in left me with lifelong friends! Maybe 
            that's why I'm so passionate about it. What I love the most about coding is 
            the happiness you feel when you FINALLY catch that bug that was ruining your
             program. In the image you can see me and my friends from a program called 
             TechGirls, We were learning Python.</p>

        <p> Basketball is one of the ways I try to stay active. 
            I'm not a pro by any means, but I like to think I am a great shooting guard.<br><br> I enjoy watching basketball matches - not the NBA, sorry Chicago Bulls - with my friends. </p>

        <p> I am a live jukebox, and my poor friends have to 
            deal with that all the time!<br> I'm always singing, 
            humming, or pounding rhythms on my desk. I also 
            love to share music, my love language is creating 
            playlists for my friends. <br> All music is good music!
             with the exception of country music of course. Here
              is one of my favorite playlists, it doesn't have a 
              specific theme, just my jams.</p>
