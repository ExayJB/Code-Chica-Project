# Code-Chica-Project

Code Chica is an 8-week session for 8th â€“ 12th-grade students to gain knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create their own website offered by LATINITAS ORG. (https://latinitasonline.org/)

I participated in 2022's fall. This is my graduating project, a personal blog website.
